## What is Identity?

Note:
Digital identity is at the core of any application - invisible yet crucial. We often take identity for granted as most of its magic happens behind the scenes. But identity plays a much larger role beyond just at the login screen for your applications.

---
## What is **Modern** Identity?

* Authentication
* Authorization
* Security
* Personalization

Note:
At a high level, we can break up identity into four distinct components: authentication, authorization, user profile, and security.

---
## Authentication
### The way you login

Note:
Authentication will dictate how users login to your application. This used to be as simple as a username and password. Who here remembers not really having any requirements for a username/password? Now it's a lot more complicated, which is a good thing. We still have the uid/pwd option, but have added social connections (FB / Twitter), enterprise federation and SSO, and even "passwordless" to the mix. Implementing all of these into your application can be a time-consuming, and even scary proposition given the stakes that are often at risk.

## Authorization
### Right access, right time
